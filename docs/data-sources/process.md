# Data Source: steampipecloud_process

Use this data source to retrieve information about a process that belongs to an identity or identity workspace.

## Example Usage

**Retrieve information about a particular process id for a workspace**

```terraform
data "steampipecloud_process" "process" {
    workspace  = "dev"
    process_id = "p_cfbum07m1tuo1pqt843g"
}
```

**Retrieve information about the last process for a pipeline**

```terraform
resource "steampipecloud_workspace" "test_user_workspace" {
    handle = "%s"
}

resource "steampipecloud_workspace_pipeline" "daily_cis_pipeline" {
    workspace_handle = steampipecloud_workspace.test_user_workspace.handle
    title = "Daily CIS Job"
    pipeline = "pipeline.save_snapshot"
    frequency = jsonencode({
      "type": "interval",
      "schedule": "daily"
    })
    args = jsonencode({
      "resource": "aws_compliance.benchmark.cis_v140",
      "snapshot_tags": {
        "series": "daily_cis"
      },
      "visibility": "workspace",
      "inputs": {},
      "notifications": {},
      "variables": {}
    })
    tags = jsonencode({
	  "name": "daily_cis_pipeline"
	})
}

data "steampipecloud_process" "process_run" {
    workspace  = steampipecloud_workspace.test_user_workspace.handle
    process_id = steampipecloud_workspace_pipeline.daily_cis_pipeline.last_process_id
}
```
